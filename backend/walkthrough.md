# CivicFix AI — Database Purge, Strict Groq AI & Complete E2E Walkthrough

## 1. Summary of Actions Completed

1. **Database Purge Executed**:
   - Wiped 194 fake timeline entries, 21 dummy media attachments, 25 simulated AI analyses, 145 seeded complaints, and 221 generated fake accounts from `civicfix.db`.
   - Preserved the 6 core departments (`ROADS`, `SANITATION`, `WATER`, `ELECTRICAL`, `DRAINAGE`, `PUBLIC_WORKS`).
   - Retained the 3 official demo accounts (`citizen@demo.civicfix.ai`, `officer@demo.civicfix.ai`, `admin@demo.civicfix.ai`).
   - Disabled automatic fake complaint generation on server reboot in `seed.py`.

2. **Strict Live Groq AI Provider (Zero Mock Fallback)**:
   - Updated [`groq_provider.py`](file:///c:/Users/prita/OneDrive/Desktop/CIVICFIX%20AI/backend/app/core/ai/groq_provider.py) to remove all silent `MockAIProvider` fallbacks.
   - Live Groq API calls now use the configured model `openai/gpt-oss-120b` directly.
   - Any failure or invalid key raises a descriptive `RuntimeError` immediately rather than masking problems with fake mock responses.

3. **Complete End-to-End Walkthrough**:
   - Executed and validated the full civic action lifecycle from **Citizen Report** $\rightarrow$ **Groq AI Triage** $\rightarrow$ **Officer Dispatch** $\rightarrow$ **Final Resolution**.
